Backtracking -> Recursion
Backtracking is the same as brute force solution. 
If the iterative Solution is not near to the final solution, we backtrack from the solution and find the optimal soultion.
The tree made from backtracking algorithm is known as state space tree. 
The difference between brute force and backtracking is that if the backtracking algorithm is applied and the solution doesn't look close, algorithm automatically backtracks.
